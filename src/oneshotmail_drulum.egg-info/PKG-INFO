Description: Use Case
        ========
        Occasionally you may be required to send the same email to a number of people. This may be for regulatory reasons for a solicitor or accountant, or simply a group of family members you need to coordinate with. Using something like MailChimp would be overkill and allowing the option to unsubscribe would cause a problem for future required emails.
        
        The emails need to be sent through a legitimate mail server, ideally the same server and account you normally use in order to reduce the risk they will be considered SPAM.
        
        **DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT TO SPAM PEOPLE!**
        
        For emails that are not ***required*** to be sent, use a mailing list instead and ensure people are on it by choice and can unsubscribe easily.
        
        Setup
        =====
        
        TODO: something about venv and requirements.txt
        
        The base directory has the file **.env-template**. Rename this to **.env** and add the necessary information for your mail server.
        
        You will need the following files. Either create them yourself or rename those provided in the **email-preparation** folder with **-template**.
        - **from.txt** - Single line with no spaces at the start or end in the format ```Sender Name <sender@address.com>```
        - **subject.txt** - Single line with no spaces at the start or end to be used as the email subject.
        - **message.txt** - Plain text over multiple lines as required. Personalise the email using ```{name}``` where you want to display the recipient's short name.
        - **contacts.csv** - First line should contain ```Short name,Full name,Email address``` with each subsequent line being the information for a single recipient. No spaces before or after the commas. The To field will be constructed as ```Full Name <Email address>```
        
        Running main.py directly
        ========================
        
        This will provide you with a simple console application allowing you to preview the message to be sent, carry out a trial run or send the emails. Each option uses the files stored in the **email-preparation** folder.
        
        In order to carry out a trial run, issue the following command in a separate console. On Linux you may need to prefix the command with ```sudo```. The emails will be constructed normally and then printed to the console running the smtpd DebuggingServer.
        
        ```commandline
        python -m smtpd -c DebuggingServer -n localhost:1025
        ```
        
        Calling the class from your own application
        ===========================================
        
        Import the class normally, adjusting for how and where you have the file on your system, then create an instance of the class.
        
        ```python
        from main import OneShot
        
        mailshot = OneShot()
        ```
        
        Once you have activated an smtpd DebuggingServer (see previous section), you can carry out a test run with the ```mailshot.simple_test_run()``` method. Alternatively you can send the emails by calling ```mailshot.simple_send()```. Neither of these methods require further interaction to complete.
        
        If you prefer to control the flow manually you can do so by calling the remaining methods as required.
        
        TODO: document the class methods fully once complete.
